## Introduction

EmployeeMS Backend is a robust solution for managing employees and departments efficiently. This backend system provides RESTful APIs for seamless integration with front-end applications.

## API Overview

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In the context of employees, the API defines endpoints for handling employee and department-related operations.

## RESTful API

RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses a set of constraints to create scalable web services. EmployeeMS follows REST principles to ensure a stateless, scalable, and standardized approach to communication between the backend and frontend.

## Architecture

The EmployeeMS Backend follows a modular and scalable architecture. Here's an overview of key components:

### Entities
- `Employee`: Represents an employee with relevant information.
- `Department`: Represents a department within the organization.

### DTOs
- `EmployeeDto`: Data Transfer Object for handling employee information.
- `DepartmentDto`: Data Transfer Object for department-related data.

### Mappers
- `EmployeeMapper`: Maps between `Employee` and `EmployeeDto`.
- `DepartmentMapper`: Maps between `Department` and `DepartmentDto`.

### Exceptions
- `ResourceNotFoundException`: Custom exception for handling resource not found scenarios.

### Services
- `IEmployeeService`: Interface defining employee-related operations.
- `IDepartmentService`: Interface defining department-related operations.
- `EmployeeService`: Implementation of `IEmployeeService`.
- `DepartmentService`: Implementation of `IDepartmentService`.

### Controllers
- `EmployeeController`: Handles HTTP requests related to employees.
- `DepartmentController`: Handles HTTP requests related to departments.

## Spring Framework

The EmployeeMS Backend is built on the Spring Framework, a powerful and widely used framework for Java-based applications. Spring provides comprehensive infrastructure support, making it easier to build robust and scalable applications.

## Spring Boot 3

Spring Boot is a project within the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of building production-ready applications with minimal configuration. EmployeeMS utilizes Spring Boot 3, taking advantage of its enhanced features and optimizations.

## Importance and Usage

EmployeeMS Backend plays a crucial role in managing employee and department data efficiently. It serves as the backbone for any frontend application interacting with employee-related functionalities. The API endpoints provided by this backend facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend systems.

## Components

### Entities

The `Employee` and `Department` entities represent the core data models of the EmployeeMS Backend.

### DTOs

Data Transfer Objects (`EmployeeDto` and `DepartmentDto`) serve as lightweight, serializable objects for efficient data exchange between different layers of the application.

### Mappers

Mappers (`EmployeeMapper` and `DepartmentMapper`) handle the conversion between entity and DTO objects, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

### Exceptions

The `ResourceNotFoundException` exception is custom-built to handle scenarios where a requested resource is not found.

### Services

The service layer contains interfaces (`IEmployeeService` and `IDepartmentService`) and their implementations (`EmployeeService` and `DepartmentService`), encapsulating the business logic for employee and department operations.

### Controllers

- **DepartmentController**

  - **`@CrossOrigin("*")`**: This annotation enables cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for the controller, allowing the front end to make requests from a different domain.

  - **`@AllArgsConstructor`**: Lombok annotation that generates a constructor with one parameter for each field in the class. Used for dependency injection.

  - **`@RestController`**: Indicates that this class is a REST controller, allowing the handling of HTTP requests and returning the response in a RESTful way.

  - **`@RequestMapping("/api/departments")`**: Specifies the base URI path for all endpoints in the controller.

  - **`@PostMapping`**: Handles HTTP POST requests. In the context of `DepartmentController`, it is likely used for creating new departments.

  - **`@GetMapping("{id}")`**: Handles HTTP GET requests with a dynamic path variable `{id}`. Used for retrieving a specific department by its ID.

  - **`@GetMapping`**: Handles HTTP GET requests without a path variable. Likely used for retrieving a list of all departments.

  - **`@PutMapping("{id}")`**: Handles HTTP PUT requests with a dynamic path variable `{id}`. Used for updating an existing department.

  - **`@DeleteMapping("{id}")`**: Handles HTTP DELETE requests with a dynamic path variable `{id}`. Used for deleting a department by its ID.

### Data Model

#### `Department`

- **`@Data`**: Lombok annotation that automatically generates getters, setters, `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode` methods for the class.

- **`@AllArgsConstructor` and `@NoArgsConstructor`**: Lombok annotations generating constructors with all parameters and an empty constructor, respectively.

- **`@Entity`**: Marks the class as a JPA entity, allowing it to be persisted in the database.

- **`@Table(name = "departments")`**: Specifies the name of the database table to which this entity is mapped.

### Exception Handling

#### `ResourceNotFoundException`

- **`@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)`**: Specifies the HTTP status code to be returned when an instance of this exception is thrown. In this case, it will return a 404 Not Found status.

### Persistence Layer

#### `DepartmentServiceImpl`

The `DepartmentServiceImpl` is an implementation of the `IDepartmentService` interface, providing business logic related to departments.

- **`@Repository`**: Indicates that this class is a Spring Data repository, responsible for data access and manipulation.

- **`@Service`**: Marks the class as a service bean, indicating that it holds the business logic. Used for autodetection and dependency injection.

- **`@AllArgsConstructor`**: Lombok annotation generates a constructor with one parameter for each field in the class, used for dependency injection.

- **`@Override`**: Indicates that the annotated method is intended to override a method declared in a superclass or interface.

Please note that these annotations are part of the Spring Boot framework, providing configuration and functionality to simplify the development of RESTful APIs and database interactions.
